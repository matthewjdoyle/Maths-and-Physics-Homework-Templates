\begin{problem}{10}
Find the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^3 + 5x^2 - 7x + 4$. Then, find all values of $x$ where the gradient of the curve is equal to zero. Determine whether each stationary point is a maximum, minimum, or point of inflection.

\begin{solution}

\end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{15}
A small metal sphere of mass 0.15 kg is attached to one end of a light inextensible string of length 0.85 m. The other end of the string is fixed to a point on a ceiling. The sphere is released from rest with the string horizontal, and swings in a vertical plane.

\begin{part}{a}{Calculate the speed of the sphere when the string makes an angle of 45° with the vertical.}{5}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}
\end{part}

\begin{part}{b}{Calculate the tension in the string when it makes an angle of 45° with the vertical.}{5}
\begin{solution}

\end{solution}
\end{part}

\begin{part}{c}{If the string can withstand a maximum tension of 12 N before breaking, determine the minimum height from which the sphere can be released horizontally without the string breaking at any point in its motion. Assume $g = 9.8~\text{m/s}^2$.}{5}
