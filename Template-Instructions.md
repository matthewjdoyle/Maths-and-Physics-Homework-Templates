# Physics/Maths Homework Template - User Guide

This document provides instructions on how to use this `Homework-Template.md` effectively.

## Overview

The homework template is designed for A-level physics and mathematics assignments, featuring:
- Professional formatting
- Dedicated sections for problems and solutions
- Support for mathematical notation via MathJax
- Clear mark allocation

## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

1. **Copy the Template**: Make a copy of `Homework-Template.md` for each new assignment
2. **Update Header Information**:
   - Fill in the student name
   - Add the current date
   - Enter the due date
   - List the relevant topics covered

### Problem Types

The template supports two problem structures:

1. **Single-answer problems** (Problem 1)
   - For straightforward questions with a single solution
   - Good for mathematical proofs, derivations, or simple calculations

2. **Multi-part problems** (Problem 2)
   - For complex questions broken into sub-parts (a, b, c, etc.)
   - Ideal for physics problems that build on previous answers

## Editing the Template

### Adding Content

1. **Problems**: 
   - Replace the sample problems with your own questions
   - Keep the mark indicators (`<span class="marks">[X marks]</span>`)
   - Ensure total marks add up correctly

2. **Mathematics**:
   - Use LaTeX syntax between single dollar signs for inline math: `$E = mc^2$`
   - For centered equations, use double dollar signs: `$$F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$`

3. **Notes/Formulas Section**:
   - Add any relevant formulas, constants, or hints in the Notes section
   - This section is optional and can be removed if not needed

### Working with Solutions

The solution areas are formatted to:
- Provide clear separation from the questions
- Include ample space for written work
- Right-align final answers

Students should write their work in the solution areas and place their final answers after the "Answer:" label.

## Exporting the Document

### PDF Export

For best results when exporting to PDF:
1. Use a Markdown editor that supports HTML/CSS (e.g., Typora, VS Code with extensions)
2. Ensure MathJax rendering is enabled
3. Export/print to PDF format
4. Check that all formatting and mathematics render correctly

### Print Settings

When printing:
- Use A4 paper size
- Set margins to "Normal" or "Default"
- Enable "Background Graphics" to preserve styling
- Consider printing in color to maintain the visual design

## Troubleshooting

- **Math Not Rendering**: Ensure you're using a viewer that supports MathJax
- **Formatting Issues**: If CSS doesn't apply correctly, try viewing in a browser first
- **Space Constraints**: Adjust the padding in solution areas if more/less space is needed

## Example Usage

The template includes:
- A calculus problem (Problem 1) worth 10 marks
- A physics pendulum problem (Problem 2) with three parts, each worth 5 marks

You can use these as examples of how to structure your own problems, or replace them entirely with new content while maintaining the formatting.
